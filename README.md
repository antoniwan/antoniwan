## 🔥 What Drives Me

I build tech that matters. My work stands at the intersection of:

- ✊🏽 Emotional design & systems thinking  
- ⚙️ Dev tooling, digital independence, and sovereign platforms  
- 🧠 Applied wisdom, rituals, and human-centered innovation  
- 🪵 Hands-on craftsmanship and artistic discipline  
- 🛠️ DIY ethos, mentorship, and sacred masculine leadership  

I work with code, words, tools, and truth.
